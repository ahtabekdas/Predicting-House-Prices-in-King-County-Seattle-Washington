# Predicting-House-Prices-in-King-County-Seattle-Washington
In this project, we set out to predict house sales in the picturesque King County, Washington State, USA, utilizing the power of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and historic data. The dataset encompasses house sales that occurred between May 2014 and May 2015. Our objective is to create an accurate predictive model that can estimate house sales prices based on various factors.

Online property companies commonly employ machine learning techniques to provide property valuations, and our focus is to employ MLR to predict actual house sales. This project offers insights into the housing market dynamics of the region and serves as a valuable resource for both homebuyers and sellers.
